    "# Contrarian view on composition over inheritance.\n",
    "The conventional wisdom is to prefer [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance). More specifically to use [delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern) over single inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the recommendation on [closing files](closing-files.html), the advice is well-intentioned but omits the fact that Python does not support it well. Python has no mechanism for embedding or forwarding methods. And the despite its famous [duck-typing](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-duck-typing), there are many cases where a type must be subclassed to be [substitutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) (particularly if implemented in CPython). \n",
    "\n",
    "The below example comes from a popular [PyCon](https://pycon.org) talk called [Beyond PEP 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M). The goal is [adapt a Java-esque interface](https://www.shawnxli.com/posts/beyond-pep-8/) into pythonic code.\n",

    "No dispute that the interface is superior, but the implementation is using delegation as if it is dogma. The usage pattern has to be extrapolated from one example, but here are the issues:\n",

    "* Custom exceptions are not helpful if they do nothing. The consumer of this code _does not_ use `NetworkElementError`, and has lost the traceback if it did. Error hiding is not error handling.\n",
    "* Comparing classes with `==` is widely considered an anti-pattern, as opposed to `is` or `issubclass`.\n",
    "* The `Route` object doesn't need to delegate. There is no reason to assume that the underlying attribute access must be lazy, particularly since the iteration could be lazy instead. A named tuple or dataclass would suffice here.\n",
    "* The `RoutingTable` object doesn't need to delegate. There is no need to support random access or lazy evaluation. Its only addition to the interface is to be sequence-like, which could be trivially accomplished by a sequence.\n",

Even naming the delegate is a pain point, because one has to decide if it is a part of the public interface or not. Should it have 0, 1, or 2 leading underscores? Delegation is often touted as achieving both encapsulation and extensibility, despite being opposing goals.\n",
