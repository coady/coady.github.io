    "# Pythonic Go code.\n",
    "The long arc of language convergence continues. With generics and iterators, Go is significantly closer to Python's reusability and expressiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the built-in function `sum`. Prior to generics, a Go version would have needed a separate implementations for `int` and `float64`. But that was the least of the problems. Even with a `Number` interface, it also would have been restricted to a `slice` of numbers. Realistically, one never has a slice of numbers. One has a slice of objects with a numeric field, or perhaps a `map` with numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter [iterators](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23#iterators). The [range over function](https://go.dev/blog/range-functions) types are clunkier than Python generators, but to the caller the `range` interface is the same."

With one key difference: the lack of generator expressions will make Go more function oriented. `slices.ContainsFunc` is the equivalent of `any`; similarly the equivalent of `all` would likely embed the predicate."

    "The big question is whether `MapFunc` and `FilterFunc` become standard. They have not been added to the `slices` package - presumably because iterators were coming - though `DeleteFunc` already managed to sneak in. Just imagine Python without comprehensions; `map` and `filter` would be ubiquitous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sort keys\n",
    "A related area of convergence is comparison functions. Go uses ternary [cmp](https://pkg.go.dev/cmp) functions, and Python [used to](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key). Collective Python experience has shown that while more general, a ternary comparison is rarely needed. Even more so with the ability to reverse and stably sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go does not have the equivalent of Python's orderable tuples, so a ternary `cmp` will always have its place. Still, sorting by scalars is extremely common, and Go could add [key-based](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/71238) ordering, with iterator support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note bound and unbound methods are also first class functions. So models with a standard ordering or identifier could add methods for each. Then pass `(*Type).Compare` as a `cmp` function, and `(*Type).Key` as a key function. The readability of function parameters is even better when referenced by name instead of a `lambda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key function approach is also simpler and more efficient for `comparable` use cases. Utilities like `slices.CompareFunc` could be `iter.CompareBy` and not repeat logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sets\n",
    "Go does not have a built-in `set` type. The options are to use a `map` explicitly, or via a library which wraps a `map` and ignores the values. The author's [iterset](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coady/iterset) package demonstrates that a Pythonic approach is now possible. Set operations require either O(1) lookup - which maps already support - or mere iteration. So a custom `map` type is useful for efficiency, but its methods can support `iter.Seq` instead, just as Python methods do. This is both more flexible and efficient in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take `IsSubset` as an example. The four interface choices have usage and performance trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `IsSubset(iter.Seq[K], iter.Seq[K])`: most flexible, has to convert right argument to #2\n",
    "1. `IsSubset(iter.Seq[K], map[K]V))`: fast, zero-copy, and flexible\n",
    "1. `IsSubset(map[K]V), iter.Seq[K]`: similar to #1, but converting the right argument may exit early and use less space\n",
    "1. `IsSubset(map[K]V1), map[K]V2)`: similar to #2, but could exit early with a size check\n",
    "\n",
    "Without function overloads, designing the interface for all use cases is a challenge. But in no case is forcing the caller to convert both arguments to `map[K]struct{}` first an improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Go has just started to include iterator utilities like `slices.Sorted{Func}`. Iterators are going to have a transformative effect on readability."
