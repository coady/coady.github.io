    "# Decorators versus blocks and partial functions.\n",
    "Decorators are a beloved feature of Python, but like any good thing can be overused. The key is acknowledging that decorators are [just functions](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator).\n",
    "\n",
    "> A function returning another function, usually applied as a function transformation using the @wrapper syntax. Common examples for decorators are classmethod() and staticmethod().\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The decorator syntax is merely syntactic sugar, the following two function definitions are semantically equivalent:\n",
    "> ``` python\n",
    "> def f(arg):\n",
    ">    ...\n",
    "> f = staticmethod(f)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">@staticmethod\n",
    ">def f(arg):\n",
    ">    ...\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Renamed\n",
    "So the critical feature of the `@` syntax is to retain the defined object's name; otherwise it is just a function call. Which leads to the first example of overuse: defining a new object just to change the name. Consider this example adapted from a [popular project](https://github.com/psf/requests)."

    "Another sign is if the decorator's functionality only executes code before or after the wrapped function. Context managers are inherently more flexible by providing the same functionality for any code block. In some cases a function boundary is natural to bookend, e.g., logging or timing. The question is whether the function block is too broad a context to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators were introduced in [version 2.4](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/which-py.html#h_25_september_19th_2006); context managers in 2.5. All ancient history now, but decorators had a ~2 year head start. For example, transactions are a [seminal use case for context managers](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.5.html#writing-context-managers), but [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) pre-dates 2.5, so it had a transaction decorator first. This is how [transactions are currently presented](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/transactions/):\n",

    "> atomic is usable both as a decorator:\n",
    ">\n",

    "> def viewfunc(request):\n",
    ">     # This code executes inside a transaction.\n",
    ">    do_stuff()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> and as a context manager:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> from django.db import transaction\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def viewfunc(request):\n",
    ">     # This code executes in autocommit mode (Django's default).\n",
    ">     do_stuff()\n",

    ">         do_more_stuff()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "So it has both, but the decorator is presented first, and is it a good example? Seems likely that a full request would have setup and teardown work that is unrelated to a database transaction. It is uncontroversial to want `try` blocks to be as narrow as possible. Surely there is no benefit to a request operation rolling back a vacuous transaction, nor a response operation rolling back a transaction that was committable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any context manager can be trivially transformed into a decorator; the converse is not true. And even if the function block is _coincidentally_ perfect, a `with` block has negligible impact on readability. It is just indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial functions\n",
    "Next is a lack of appreciation of partially bound functions. Many decorator examples go out of their way to write an unnecessary `def` statement, in order to make using a decorator look natural. The below example is common in [Python tutorials](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/#decorators-with-arguments)."
